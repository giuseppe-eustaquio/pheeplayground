// Every game in the Playground is listed here.
//
// To add a game:
//   1. Create games/<id>/game.js that exports  mount(container)  and returns
//      { destroy() }  (see games/matching-pairs/game.js for an example).
//   2. Add an entry below.
//
// Games are loaded on demand, so a heavy game (for example one that uses
// Phaser) only downloads its code when someone actually opens it.
