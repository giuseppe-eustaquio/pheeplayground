# Phee Playground

A plain HTML/CSS/JS site with a welcome page, Internet Stuff, a Playground of
games, n8n workflow demos, and an About page.

## Run it locally

```bash
python3 serve.py        # http://localhost:8000
```

`serve.py` is a small dev server. It also refreshes the Phee photo list
(`images/phee/manifest.json`) and the thumbnails (`images/phee/thumbs/`)
whenever you add or remove photos.

Thumbnails need Pillow once: `pip install pillow`. Without it everything
still works, the games just load the full-size photos.

## Git hook (one time per clone)

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Before every commit the hook refreshes the manifest and thumbnails and adds
them to the commit, so the deployed site always matches `images/phee/`.

## Project layout

```
index.html              welcome page
about.html              about Giuseppe and the project
internet-stuff.html     API-powered curiosities
playground.html         games and activities
css/style.css           site styles
js/main.js              shared theme, accent colour, navigation, Cornify, ...
js/internet-stuff.js    Dog CEO/Phee photos and API-powered diversions
js/phee.js              shared helper for the Phee photos
games/registry.js       the list of games (add new games here)
games/playground.js     the Playground: game list + opens a game
games/shared.js         helpers games can use (loadCss, shuffle)
games/<id>/game.js      one folder per game
games/<id>/game.css     that game's styles
```

## Adding a game

1. Make `games/<id>/game.js` that exports `mount(container)` and returns
   `{ destroy() }`. Build the game inside `container`; undo everything
   (timers, listeners, a Phaser instance, ...) in `destroy()`.
2. Add an entry to `games/registry.js` with an `id`, `title`, `blurb` and
   `load: () => import("./<id>/game.js")`.

Games are loaded only when opened, and each game decides what it uses.
Simple games can use plain DOM and CSS (like Matching Pairs). A game that
needs Phaser can load it from its own `mount()` without affecting the rest.

Each game has its own link: `#playground/<id>`.

The home page shows a random Phee photo and links to the two main sections.
Internet Stuff hosts the Dog CEO/Phee photo picker, useless facts, Advice Slip
search and random advice, and filtered JokeAPI jokes. The fixed Cornify button
loads Cornify on demand when clicked on any page. Turbo Tetris is a plain
JavaScript and CSS game; it draws its 10×20
board and standard tetrominoes directly. Its falling piece continues over the
visible page to the document bottom, so it does not need an external game
library or image assets.
